## Hello
I'm PsychicSimp. No idea why you're here. But here goes.

### About
I am still in high school right now, I like to code on and off- whenever time permits. I am currently into Discord Bot developing and prefer to code with Python.
Still Eager to learn and accomplish more in the field!

### Projects/Past Trials
I tried Roblox game development before, so you can assume that I know a little bit of Lua.
Right now, I am into developing Alfred Wigans- a discord bot ([invite link)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=744149940082835577&permissions=0&scope=bot) but thats a large WIP. You can't expect me to be done with it anytime soon.
