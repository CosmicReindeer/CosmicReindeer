## Hello
I'm Aryan, a 15 year old web developer.

![Aryan's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=aryan340&custom_title=Aryan's+Stats&count_private=true&include_all_commits=true&hide=stars,issues&theme=react)

### Past Trials/ Experience
I got into programming through roblox game development (you can assume I know a little bit of lua).
However, I found python more interesting and spent a few months learning it, before going into discord
bot development. I got to know python a lot more by using the library.
Right now, I am familiar with web-frameworks like django and am building RESTful + ws apis with it (inspired by discord's architecture).

Right now, I am in highschool and like to code on and off - whenever time permits.
