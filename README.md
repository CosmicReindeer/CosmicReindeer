### Past Trials/ Experience
I got into programming through roblox game development (you can assume I know a little bit of lua).
However, I found python more interesting and spent a few months learning it, before going into discord
bot development. I got to know python a lot more by using the library.
Right now, I am familiar with web-frameworks like django and am building RESTful + ws apis with it (inspired by discord's architecture).

Right now, I am in highschool and like to code on and off - whenever time permits.
