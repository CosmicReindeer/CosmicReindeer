## Hello
I'm PsychicSimp. No idea why you're here. But here goes.

### About
I am still in high school right now, I like to code on and off- whenever time permits.
Still Eager to learn and accomplish more in the field!

### Projects/Past Trials
I tried Roblox game development before, so you can assume that I know a little bit of Lua.
I also worked on discord.py bot development for about two months, I am quite proficient in it.
Right now I am working with tkinter GUIs and the like, regarding desktop app development.
